# itsTime
This project is google extention for a countdown timer that allows users to set an event with a specific date. 
It saves the event details (name and date) using Chrome's chrome.storage.sync API, and it automatically displays a countdown to the event. Once the event date arrives, the application will show a message indicating that today is the day or that the event has already passed.
